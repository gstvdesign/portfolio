This is a portfolio website that presents my work as a UX designer.

## Tech stack

I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [styled components]() for styling, and [Dato CMS]() to manage the content.

## TO DOs

- [ ] Smarter styling

I didn't have much time to build the portfolio so there is a lot of repetition of values. Also everything is measured in pixels (I prefer relative measures – em, rem, % or fr – than fixed pixels). 

- [ ] Mobile experience

- [ ] Animations and interactions

## Made with Next JS bootstrap

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
